### Issues

1- Hover on the element on the touch screen hover be sticky on tap

- To avoid this issue add this media quairy for devices that can hover (desktops, laptops, non touch screen).

```
@media (hover: hover) {
    .class:hover {
    }
}
```
2- When hover over button the tooltip visible correctly on desktop but on the touch screen not visible correctly

- To avoid this issue hide the tooltip on the touch screen and add this media quairy 
```
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .class:hover: {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
